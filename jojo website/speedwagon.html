                <p class="centertext">Speedwagon as he appears in the anime</p>
                <p>Robert E.O Speedwagon is a God among men. He stands at an enormous 7 feet tall and has the strength of 17 bodybuilders combined. However he has decided to not use his immense strength and instead allow his allies to defeat their opponents. His true dream is to cheer his friends from the sidelines as they achieve their goals. Speedwagon possesses an enormous 2,000 IQ and the ability to smell a dishonest person.</p>

                <h4>Phantom Blood</h4>
                <img class="rightimg" id="speedmanga" src="pictures/speedwagon manga.png" alt="fuck">
                <p>Speedwagon is the first ultimate life form, who just so happened to stumble upon Jonathan Joestar on the infamous Shrek memorial street. Speedwagon smelled Jonathan and deemed him worthy of his help on his quest to stop the evil Dio Brando. Our main man Robert E.O. Speedwagon does not use his immense power for fear  of injuring Jonathan or Baron Zeppeli. He mostly stays in the background, giving them his strength in the form of his cheers. After Dio is defeated Speedwagon destroys the stone mask and wishes Jonathan and Erina a safe trip to America for their honeymoon. When Speedwagon heard of Jonathans death, it is said that he shed his first and only tear of his entire life.</p>

                <h4>Battle Tendency</h4>
                <p>An "older" Speedwagon is seen in Battle Tendency. (Older is in quotation marks because Speedwagon does not age. He only chooses to appear like that.) Before the events of Part 2 Speedwagon discovered oil in America and became the richest man in the entire world. He used his immense fortune to start the Speedwagon Foundation, a company that specializes in scientific and medical breakthroughs every hour of the day. Our boi was checking out the pillarman Santana when the Hamon master he brought with him through him in the river. He was then "taken hostage' by Von Stroheim. He only let himself get captured so he could work his way up and kill Hitler. Eventually Joseph "saves" him and he goes back to America to find a way to stop the pillarmen. He is then seen in the final episodes, watching his men shine flashlights on an ultra powerful Kars. Now you're thinking "why didn't Speedwagon stop Kars?" Well that's a good question, he didn't feel like it that day.</p>

                <h4>Death</h4>
                <p>Eventually Speedwagon grew tired of this mortal world. He gave himself a heart attack at the age of 347 years old and moved onto the next life. A lifelong bachelor he left no children behind. Because he never had children he is therefore the ultimate Chad. Upon his death, the world was forced into an extreme mourning period that lasted almost 7 and a half years. He left his entire fortune to the Speedwagon Foundation with the condition that they always help the Joestars no matter the cost.</p>
